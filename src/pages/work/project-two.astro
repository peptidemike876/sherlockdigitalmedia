          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            For the 2025 Tony Awards, I contributed motion design and 3D digital set content for live theatrical performances broadcast to a global audience. The project required close coordination across creative, technical, and broadcast teams to deliver visually compelling content that supported the pacing, storytelling, and prestige of the ceremony.

          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>
            I designed and animated 3D digital environments and performance-specific motion content, collaborating with producers, directors, and artists to align visuals with each number’s creative intent. My responsibilities included interpreting creative direction, developing performance-ready visuals, and ensuring all content was optimized for live broadcast and seamless integration within the show’s production workflow.

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>
            The final visuals elevated the live performances while respecting the theatrical legacy and elegance of the Tony Awards. The motion content integrated smoothly into the broadcast and stage environments, enhancing storytelling without overpowering the performers. The work contributed to a cohesive, polished live show and was delivered successfully under tight production timelines.
