          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The Grand Ole Opry celebrated its 100th anniversary throughout 2025. A major 3-hour NBC television special, <strong>Opry 100: A Live Celebration</strong>, hosted by Blake Shelton, aired on March 19, 2025, featuring over 50 Opry members. The event showcased a custom-designed 3D set and performance graphics created by Michael Sherlock and produced by MDots to honor the Opry's rich history and legacy.

          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>
            For the Opry 100 Celebration concert, I designed and animated the 3D digital set and created custom motion content for multiple live performances. I collaborated closely with producers, directors, and artists to develop visuals that complemented each performance while supporting the overall creative vision of the show. My role involved translating creative concepts into dynamic, performance-ready visuals and ensuring seamless integration with the live production environment.

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>
            The final visuals enhanced the live performances while maintaining the heritage and prestige of the Opry brand. The digital set and motion content integrated seamlessly into the live production, supporting storytelling onstage without distracting from the artists. The work contributed to a cohesive, visually elevated concert experience and was successfully delivered on time in collaboration with the full production team.
