    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I’m a motion designer and digital media specialist focused on
      helping brands explain complex ideas with clarity and restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work sits at the intersection of design, storytelling,
      and motion — built to feel intentional, modern, and human.
